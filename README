Idea: only one method per class: combine functions into
JSR_FILES_ITERATOR for example.

But not sure if that will work, would it? JRS_FILES_ITERATOR inherits
from JRS_ITERATOR which can iterate over a collection G. Perhaps
inherit from a Gobo iterator as you basically have a collection of
files over which you can either iterator or do some specific pre-coded
function.


JRS:

glob ("*.html").grep ("whatever").words (agent ...)
