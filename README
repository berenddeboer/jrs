Idea: only one method per class: combine functions into
JSR_FILES_ITERATOR for example.

But not sure if that will work, would it? JRS_FILES_ITERATOR inherits
from JRS_ITERATOR which can iterate over a collection G. Perhaps
inherit from a Gobo iterator as you basically have a collection of
files over which you can either iterator or do some specific pre-coded
function.


JRS:

glob ("*.html").grep ("whatever").words (agent ...)


A new kind of Eiffel for writing type safe HTML:

html.
  head.
    meta.http_equiv ("Content-Type").content ("text/html; charset=UTF-8").end.
    title.text ("test").end.
  end.
  body.
    h1.text ("Hello World").end.
    p.text ("Hello!").end.
  end.
end
